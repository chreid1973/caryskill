# Borrow-a-Skill — GitHub‑importable

This folder is ready to push to GitHub and open in StackBlitz in one click.

## Quick push to GitHub
1. Create a new repo at https://github.com/new (Public is fine)
2. On the repo page, click **"uploading an existing file"**
3. Drag & drop the **contents of this folder** (not the folder itself) into GitHub’s upload page
4. Commit the changes

## Open in StackBlitz from GitHub
- Go to: `https://stackblitz.com/github/<your-username>/<your-repo>`  
  (replace with your GitHub username and repo name)

StackBlitz will install dependencies and run the Vite dev server automatically.

## Local dev
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
